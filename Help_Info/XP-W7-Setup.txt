For UEFI + BIOS booting from USB then Windows 8.1 x64 need to be used as Source.
There are now three Universal solutions for booting from USB on UEFI + BIOS computers:
- Win8.1SE x64 boot.wim of size 400 MB booting from RAMDISK
- Portable W864USP1.vhd of size 3.5 GB booting as FILEDISK
- Full Windows 8.1 Pro installed in 15 GB VHD or any Windows 8.1 on USB SYSTEM partition of size 50 GB

====================================================================================================================
 
How to Install Windows 7/8 in VHD and to Make Mini 7/8 VHD for booting from USB ?

- Direct Install Windows 7 Ultimate or 8 Pro in a 15 GB VHD file on local harddisk created by WinNTSetup_x64.exe with Ctrl + Shift + V
- Boot Drive can be FAT32 or NTFS USB-Stick made with UFD_FORMAT.exe so that normal booting of the internal harddisk is not changed

 1. Boot from USB or from Network with Win8.1SE x64 boot.wim selected in Boot Manager Menu
 2. Use portable App WinNTSetup_x64.exe and click tab Windows 7/8
 3. Select Installation files - Use R-mouse to mount 7/8 Setup ISO file in ImDisk Virtual Drive
 4. Use WinNTSetup button VHD to Create 15 GB VHD file on local harddisk
 5. Select Boot Drive (USB-Stick) and Installation Drive (mounted VHD file) for Install of 7/8
    In WinNTSetup3 - Tweaks - Select all System Tweaks so that UAC is off etc.
 6. WinNTSetup3 - Setup will prepare VHD on local harddisk for Install of 7/8
 7. Reboot from Boot Drive and Install 7/8 in VHD
 8. Open Device Manager via R-mouse on My Computer
 9. Install missing drivers by using extracted DriverPacks

After booting with Windows 7/8 VHD then Check to have Switched Off :
UAC + Defender + pagefile + System Restore + Hibernate + Windows Update + Action Center settings Disable ALL options

Hibernate OFF is needed via cmd window with

powercfg -h OFF

Install FiraDisk driver with R-mouse on firadisk.inf in makebt\firadisk-driver- folder
The 64-bit FiraDisk driver requires to boot with testsigning switched on

Open Command Prompt as Administrator:

bcdedit /set testsigning on

Reboot to activate testsigning - Info http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff553484.aspx

- After Install then Copy Windows 7/8 VHD file to USB and use USB_W78_Fix.exe to fix for booting from USB-drive


Install 7/8 in VHD and Make Mini 7/8 VHD for booting from USB
http://reboot.pro/topic/18467-vhd-w8-compact-make-mini-8/
http://reboot.pro/topic/18593-vhd-w7-compact-make-mini-7/

Install XP in VHD and Make Mini XP VHD for booting from USB
http://reboot.pro/topic/18547-vhd-xp-setup-install-xp-in-vhd/
http://reboot.pro/topic/18657-vhd-xp-compact-make-mini-xp/

The XP/7/8 Mini Windows VHD's of 1.2 - 2.5 GB are loaded from USB-Stick into RAMDISK by Grub4dos and using WinVBlock or FiraDisk driver
Grub4dos booting with VHD loaded into RAMDISK cannot be used on UEFI computers.

For UEFI + BIOS booting then Windows 8.1 x64 need to be used as Source.
You can make Portable W864USP1.vhd of size 3.5 GB for booting from USB and direct selected in Boot Manager Menu.

How to prepare XP Setup Source ? - Prepare XP Setup ISO file with integrated UpdatePack and DriverPacks

Take care that your XPSOURCE Folder is located on your Harddisk in a simple Path without SPACES.
Copy the Content of your Windows XP Setup CD to your XPSOURCE Folder on Harddisk 

First Integrate ServicePack SP3 in your XP-SP2 Source (don't use here nLite).
http://www.helpwithwindows.com/WindowsXP/Slipstreaming_Windows_XP_Service_Pack_3.html
Download from - http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=24

In Command Window use for English version and XPSOURCE folder on drive E:

[code]WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe /integrate:E:\XPSOURCE[/code]

Siginet's RyanVM Integrator 1.6 can then be used to Integrate Windows UpdatePacks in the XP-Source. 
http://integrator.siginetsoftware.com/index.php?download
Download preferred version RVM Integrator 1.6.1 Beta 2.1

Windows XP UpdatePacks and Addons:

Onepiece XP Post-SP3 AIO International Update Packs FINAL - http://www.ryanvm.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10445
Dutch Update Pack - http://www.ryanvm.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8428

Work according to Section 2 in - http://www.911cd.net/forums//index.php?showtopic=25345

For Install of XP on a modern system with SATA Drives it is needed to use DPsBase.exe 
for Integrating in your XPSOURCE DriverPack Massstorage with TXT Mode Enabled.
http://driverpacks.net/downloads
In that case a lot of Extra RAID SCSI and SATA Drivers (about 120 extra) are Integrated which appear in the 
XP Setup BootFolder $WIN_NT$.~BT on Install-Drive and can prevent a lot of XP Install Boot Problems.
Use DPsBase.exe to Integrate DriverPacks Chipset + Processor + MassStorage + LAN + WLAN DriverPacks
which will then be located in OEM Folder in your XPSOURCE folder
Always first use RyanVM Integrator and then use DPsBase to Improve your XP-Source
DPsBase makes presetup.cmd in folder I386 and changes the I386\winnt.sif file for use of DriverPacks

presetup.cmd in folder I386 will start decompression of DriverPacks located in OEM folder 
at the beginning of GUI-mode of XP Setup, which does NOT take to much time for the 5 DriverPacks

You should select to Keep The Drivers for Chipset + Processor + MassStorage + LAN
Then WINDOWS\DriverPacks is about 135 MB which is acceptable and provides a lot of extra driver support 
which is useful to make XP Universal and adapt easily to very different hardware.
In that case the DevicePath is set accordingly in key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion 
so that XP can automatically make use of these drivers for adjusting to New Hardware

When you don't use nLite, you can copy the supplied $OEM$ folder to your XP Source folder
Change $OEM$ folder to your needs for UserAccounts and Registry Tweaks and Adding Drivers
CMDLINES.TXT is used for making UserAccounts and install of Registry Tweaks at T-12
Info see: http://unattended.msfn.org/unattended.xp/

Use DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe to Install from C:\Drivers at T-9 of GUI XP Setup (just for the last Reboot).
DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe was made by kickarse http://www.msfn.org/board/index.php?showtopic=110783
At end of TXT-mode XP Setup the folder $OEM$\$1\Drivers is copied to C:\Drivers
and $OEM$\$1\Install\DriverForge.v4.5.4.exe is copied to C:\Install
For Auto Use of DriverForge at T-9 add uncompressed driver folders in $OEM$\$1\Drivers
and Uncomment two rules by removing ; in winnt.sif file copied from winnt_sif to your I386 folder
This is very useful for Install of your well known Audio and Video driver during GUI-mode of XP Setup.

[SetupParams]
UserExecute = "%SystemDrive%\INSTALL\SetupPar.cmd"

Smart Driver Backup 2.12 of Jaque is very useful to Backup your drivers before install of XP

How to make XP Setup ISO File ?

- Use BBIE (see below) or Isobuster to Extract Boot Image bootsect.bin from Original bootable XP Setup CD 
  bbie will make image1.bin that you can copy as bootsect.bin to XP Setup source folder
- Reduce Size of XP Setup Source folder (if needed to fit on CD then remove folders LANG  WIN9XMIG  WIN9XUPG)
- Use ImgBurn and bootsect.bin to make Bootable CD

1. Remove 3 folders LANG  WIN9XMIG  WIN9XUPG - reduction in size = 135 MB
2. Run ImgBurn - Portable Tool in PStart Menu - IMG_XP\MULTI\PStart\Progs\ImgBurn
